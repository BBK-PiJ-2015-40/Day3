/*2 Calculator
Write a program that reads two numbers from the user and then offers a menu with the four basic operations:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the user has selected an operation from the menu, the
calculator performs the operation.
Hint: In the same way that there exists an Integer.parseInt() method to parse integers, there is a Double.parseDouble()
method to parse real numbers.
